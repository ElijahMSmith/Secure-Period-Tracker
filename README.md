## A security-first period-tracker for a post-Roe America.

Many Americans who menstruate now live in states where abortion is banned. Both technology and legal experts have recommended that people who menstruate should stop using period-tracking apps since law enforcement may issue subpoenas or warrants for your private medical data.

Some apps advertise that they "encrypt" your data. However, while these products may encrypt your data during transmission, it's likely a copy of it is still stored on their servers, which means your private data is still accessible to be given out, subpoenaed, and/or asked for in a warrant.

*The only way to make data 100% fascist-proof is to make sure the data can't be given out in the first place.*

### That's why we've created the first period-tracking app where your data is entirely *yours*.

When you use our app, data *never* leaves the client device. That means we can't couldn't give out your data, even if we wanted to.

While the data is stored on your device, it's encrypted with AES-256, the same encryption standard used by the US military. Now that's a tough nut for a pig to crack.
